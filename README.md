# Multithreaded Proxy Server and Client

This repository contains the code for a Multithreaded Proxy Server and Client, developed as a part of our final project. The application serves as an intermediary between a client (user) and the internet, receiving requests from clients, forwarding them to the web server, and returning the resulting HTML file saved to a local directory.

## Usage

### Using A Terminal

1. Unzip the code files (`MultiThreadedProxyServer.java` and `ProxyClient.java`) into a single directory.
2. Compile both files in the terminal:
    ```bash
    javac MultiThreadedProxyServer.java
    javac ProxyClient.java
    ```
3. Run the `ProxyClient.java` in the terminal:
    ```bash
    java ProxyClient
    ```

### Using An IDE

1. Unzip the files into the same directory and open them in your IDE of choice.
2. In your IDE, go to `ProxyClient.java` and click Run/Start.

## Note
Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to set up and run the Multithreaded Proxy Server and Client successfully.
