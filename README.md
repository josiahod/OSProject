# OSProject

We created a Multithreaded Proxy Server and Client for our final project. The application is an intermediary between a client (user) and the internet. For the input, it receives a request from the client, in this case, a URL, & forwards it to the web server. For the output, it returns an html file saved to a local directory. The code was written using java and can be ran following the instructions found below:

Using A Terminal
Unzip the code files (MultiThreadedProxyServer.java and ProxyClient.java) into a single directory
2. Compile both files (javac MultiThreadedProxyServer.java / javac ProxyClient.java) in terminal
Run the ProxyCLient.java in the terminal with â€œjava ProxyClient.java)
Using An IDE
Unzip the files into the same directory and open them in your IDE of choice.
Go to ProxyClient.java and click Run/Start in your IDE
